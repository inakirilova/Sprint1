# Envelope Analysis task 02

# General requirements
1.	When passing invalid parameters for execution, 
the application should not crash.
2.	Running without parameters displays instructions for using the program.
3.	Parameters are passed in the order given in the job description.

## 2.	Envelope Analysis

There are two envelopes with sides (a,b) and (c,d) to determine if one envelope can be put inside the
other. The program must handle the input of floating point numbers. The program asks the user for envelope
sizes one parameter at a time. After each calculation, the program asks the user if he wants to continue. If the
user answers “y” or “yes” (case insensitive), the program continues from the beginning, otherwise it terminates
the execution.

### Launching the program:
By running the Main class and follow the instructions on the console.
