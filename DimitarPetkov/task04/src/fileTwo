You need to write a program that will have two modes:
1. Count the number of occurrences of a string in a text file.
2. Replace a line with another one in the specified file string
The program must accept input arguments at startup:
1. <string to file> <string to count>
2. <string to file> <string to search for> <string string to replace>
